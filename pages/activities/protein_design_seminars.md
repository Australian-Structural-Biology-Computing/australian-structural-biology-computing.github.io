## Details

- Computational protein design can produce synthetic proteins that disrupt the function of a target protein.
- Australian community members are actively using protein design technology to solve biological problems.
- Community members will host a monthly seminar series to share knowledge on protein design strategies to get the best outcomes from protein design projects.
