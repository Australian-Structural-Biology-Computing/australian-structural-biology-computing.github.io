## [ToolFinder](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/toolfinder/)

To find software installed on Australian compute systems, you can make use of the ToolFinder service.
Example structural biology searches of the service are included below:

[Protein folds and structural domains](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/toolfinder/?topic=protein_folds_and_structural_domains)

[Protein folding, stability and design](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/toolfinder/?topic=protein_folding_stability_and_design)

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The ToolFinder searches above use EDAM ontology concepts as a filter,
specifically 'Topics'. For more information, and to navigate the ontology, you can visit the EDAM browser: <https://edamontology.github.io/edam-browser/>" %}


## [bio.tools registry](https://bio.tools/)

bio.tools is a software registry. Here you can also search the curated software list for the [ELIXIR `3D-BioInfo` community on bio.tools](https://bio.tools/t?domain=3d-bioinfo). You can find out more about the community on [their website](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/3d-bioinfo).
